# ChessProject
Successfully developed a comprehensive chess engine from the ground up using Java. This chess engine not only offers traditional gameplay but also boasts advanced features that enhance the overall chess experience. It can intelligently identify and prevent incorrect or illegal moves made by players, ensuring a fair and error-free game.

Furthermore, the engine showcases an aesthetically pleasing graphical user interface (GUI) that not only facilitates gameplay but also adds to the overall visual appeal. This GUI provides a user-friendly and immersive environment for players to enjoy the game.
